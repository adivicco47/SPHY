# turned on, then the routing module should be switched off.

# Reservoirs module. This module can be used to model reservoir inflow, outflow, and storage. A
# simple or advanced reservoir operation schedule can be selected for each individual reservoir.

# Groundwater module. This distincs between the use of a groundwater reservoir or the use of a
# seepage flux (bottom boundary condition). If the groundwater module is chosen, then percolation
